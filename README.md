A scraper to scrape data on awarded contracts from [Contracts Finder](https://www.gov.uk/contracts-finder. The code leaves a respectful number of time.sleeps() inbetween requests, although it does attempt to scrape the entire awarded database of >250k contracts. The code is based on Python's Selenium module. To install all necessary dependencies, please do something like `pip install -r requirements.txt` after cloning the repository.
